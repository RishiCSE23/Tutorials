    "## Topics \n",
    "1. __Compute Service Architecture:__ Understanding the overall service based model. \n",
    "2. __Implementation of Compute Hosts in the User Plane:__ Implementaion with several hypervior back-ends (baremetals and container)\n",
    "3. __Managing Flavours:__ template based resource allocation \n",
    "4. __Managing Keypairs:__ Securing access to the copute hosts\n",
    "5. __Security Groups:__ Access-lists and firewalls to control network traffic    \n",
    "6. __Resource Quotas:__ Controlled provissioning of resources\n",
    "7. __Manage Compute Hosts:__ play with instances  \n",
    "8. __Compute Service Monitoring:__ Telemetry  \n",

    "## 1.1. Nova Compute Architecture\n",
    "![](figs/nova_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Nova Core components__ \n",
    "    * __API__: Communicates with cloud users and other OpenStack services (e.g. Security, Networking, Images and Volume). \n",
    "    * __Conductor__: Intermediatory between Compute hosts and Nova Database  \n",
    "    * __Schedular__: Decides where to place an instance to run them? \n",
    "* __Nova DB__: Store nova states (current state of compute service with all virtual resources and state of the instances).\n",
    "* __Compute Hosts__ \n",
    "    * Executes cloud user instances\n",
    "    * Download images form glance and maintain them in a cache.  \n",
    "    * Updates Glance images with snapshots. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Nova Compute in User Plane \n",
    "![](figs/nova_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* __KVM Mackend__: Nova compute sends instruction to the respective hypervisor backend\n",
    "* __ESXi Backend__: For ESXi backend the communication takes place between VCenter and Nova. VCenter is responsible for placing the instance into ESXi hosts, Nova is not responsible for plaing in a Host, that is done by the VMWare DRS (Dynamic Resource Scheduler).  \n",
    "* __Baremetal Backend__: Nova Communicates with Ironic service to provission a Bare metal server. \n",
    "* __Container backend__: There are three ways to launch Containers:\n",
    "    1. __Magnum__: Launch Docker Natively and manage using Docker Swarm.\n",
    "    2. __LXC__: Provission containers with LXC drivers and treat them as Instances.\n",
    "    3. __Zun__: Openstack native serice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing SSH Keypairs\n",
    "* Secure access to instance shell from external networks. SSH sessions are secured by encrypting the traffic using a _Asymetric Key Crypto System_ e.g., RSA. \n",
    "* Private-Public key pair:\n",
    "    * __Public Key:__ Injected to an instance at boot time and owned by the owner of the instance. \n",
    "    * __Private Key:__ Stored in secured file on local file system and used by the `ssh` command to access instance. \n",
    "* Keypair action:\n",
    "    * __Create__: Using openstack or external KeyGen (upload manually). \n",
    "    * __Delete__: Delete an existing key\n",
    "    * __List__: list all public keys\n",
    "    * __Show__: show details \n",
